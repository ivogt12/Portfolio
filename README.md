## Scripts

In the project directory(portfolio), you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

### `nodemon server`

These commands will host the project locally, opening up localhost:3000 in your preferred web browser.

## Technologies

This is a MERN stack application(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). CSS was used for styling and Mongoose was used as an Object Relational Mapper.

## Purpose

This app was built for CPSC 362 for Assignment One. It demonstrates a working professional portfolio for Isaiah Vogt. The Portfolio contains featured projects, a downloadable resume, an about me section, and a contact form routed to a MongoDB Atlas connection.

## Templates

This app's wireframe was designed on canva.com. Here are the models for the initial design:

## Features to Be Added

# Bugs

  The footer home button is not properly routed.

  The Submition button in the contact form is functional but not responsive visually. It also does not have proper input validation.

# Features

  Refactor code using passing props instead of repeating functions.

  More projects from my github/portfolio will be added soon.

  The general UI/UX should be more polished(open-ended). The padding/margins for the about page are not completed as intended. The Contact form is not spaced and neat as intended.

  A centered, professional headshot will be added to the home page.

  The about page will have another picture of myself.

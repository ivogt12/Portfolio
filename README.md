## Scripts

In the project directory(portfolio), you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

### `nodemon server`

These commands will host the project locally, opening up localhost:3000 in your preferred web browser.

## Technologies

This is a MERN stack application(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). CSS was used for styling and Mongoose was used as an Object Relational Mapper.

## Purpose

This app was built for CPSC 362 for Assignment One. It demonstrates a working professional portfolio for Isaiah Vogt. The Portfolio contains featured projects, a downloadable resume, an about me section, and a contact form routed to a MongoDB Atlas connection.
